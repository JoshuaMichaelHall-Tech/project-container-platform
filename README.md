# Secure Container Platform for Financial Services

## ðŸš§ PROJECT STATUS: IN DEVELOPMENT

**Note**: This is an AI-generated project template created as part of my DevOps learning journey. Active development will begin as I progress through my Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS ECS training.

## Project Overview

This project implements a comprehensive container security platform tailored for financial services applications, providing secure image management, runtime protection, and compliance monitoring. It creates a secure container ecosystem that enables financial institutions to adopt containerization while maintaining strict security and regulatory compliance.

> **Note**: This project is currently in the planning stage. Documentation and implementation will evolve as development progresses.

## Key Features

- Secure container registry with vulnerability scanning
- Image signing and verification workflow
- Runtime security monitoring and enforcement
- Network policy implementation for container isolation
- Secrets management integration
- Compliance reporting and audit trails
- Auto-remediation for common security issues

## Technologies

- Docker for containerization
- AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS)
- AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR)
- Trivy for vulnerability scanning
- Open Policy Agent (OPA) for policy enforcement
- AWS Secrets Manager for secrets
- Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring

## Business Value

This platform enables financial institutions to leverage containerization while maintaining security and compliance, accelerating application deployment cycles by 50% and reducing security incidents through automated scanning and enforcement. It demonstrates how to implement a secure container strategy that satisfies regulatory requirements while enabling development agility.

## Getting Started

> Coming soon: Instructions for setting up the development environment and deploying the platform.

## Security Features

The platform implements multiple security controls:

1. **Image Scanning**: Automatically scans container images for vulnerabilities
2. **Image Signing**: Ensures only trusted images are deployed
3. **Runtime Protection**: Monitors and prevents suspicious activity in containers
4. **Network Policies**: Enforces container isolation and network segmentation
5. **Secrets Management**: Securely manages and distributes secrets to containers
6. **Compliance Monitoring**: Continuously monitors compliance with security policies

## Compliance and Security

This platform is designed to support compliance with:
- PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)
- SOC 2 (System and Organization Controls)
- GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
